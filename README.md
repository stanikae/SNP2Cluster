# SNP2Cluster

## Core SNP-based clustering for enhanced transmission cluster detection in outbreak scenarios

SNP2Cluster is a K-means clustering-based method that identifies transmission clusters by integrating genomic and epidemiological data.

> Four types of cluster analyses are possible using SNP2Cluster:

1. Core SNP cluster analysis - using SNP data only
2. Transmission cluster analysis:
    1. Facility level analysis - STs and clusters visualized strictly per facility
    1. Area/location level analysis - STs and facilities grouped by location
    1. Community level analysis - facilities grouped by ST
